#Blogger

This is my first Ruby on Rails project.
I created a simple blog system and learned the basics of RoR including:
 ->   Models, Views, and Controllers (MVC)
 ->   Data Structures & Relationships
 ->   Routing
 ->   Migrations
 ->   Views with forms, partials, and helpers
 ->   RESTful design
 ->   Adding gems for extra features
